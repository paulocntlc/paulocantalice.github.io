Hi! I’m Paulo, a Brazilian editor and translator with a passion for turning complexity into clarity. With a background in languages and years of experience in writing and editing, I am looking for an opportunity as a tech writer. I approach every project with precision, empathy, and a keen eye for detail.

A not so brief history in IT
======

My involvement with computing began early, but it was only at the end of my undergraduate studies that I became interested in this career path. I graduated in Languages at UFMG and, in my final years of studies, a new laboratory was created in our building, the [ADA](http://www.letras.ufmg.br/nucleos/ada/). The aim was to enhance Linguistics students' skills by introducing programming tools. It was when I started taking classes with the lab's professors and wrote my final project on Natural Language Processing. The work was done with the goal of thinking of ways to use Artificial Intelligence to learn more about the Brazilian publishing market. If you have some time, you can check it right [here](https://paulocntlc.github.io//paulocantalice.github.io//files/TCC.pdf). Now, I'm taking a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/start-your-career-as-user-assistance-developer/?couponCode=CMCPSALE24) of Technical Writing at Udemy. I hope to put everything I'm learning into practice soon!

Future goals
======
I am very excited to learn more about the area of ​​technical documentation. For the future, I want to continue studying the links between computing and natural language in academia. Both areas have a lot to gain from each other and it is necessary to understand the opportunities that they present together.
