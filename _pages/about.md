Hi! I’m Paulo, a Brazilian writer with a passion for turning complexity into clarity. With a background in languages and years of experience in writing and editing, I am looking for an opportunity as a tech writer. I approach every project with precision, empathy, and a keen eye for detail. Let’s work together!

Experience in IT
======

My involvement with computing began early, but it was only at the end of my undergraduate studies that I became interested in this career path. I graduated in Languages at UFMG and, in my final years of studies, a new laboratory was created in our building, the [ADA](http://www.letras.ufmg.br/nucleos/ada/). The aim was to enhance Linguistics students' skills by introducing programming tools. It was when I started taking classes with the lab's professors and wrote my final project on Natural Language Processing. The work was done with the goal of thinking of ways to use Artificial Intelligence to learn more about the Brazilian publishing market.
